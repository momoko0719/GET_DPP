    "flashcard1front": "What is diabetes?",
    "flashcard1back": "Diabetes is a long-lasting health issue that happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it produces properly.",
    "flashcard2front": "What is insulin?",
    "flashcard2back": "Insulin is a hormone, like a key that unlocks cells, allowing them to absorb sugar (glucose) from the blood, which helps regulate blood sugar levels.",
    "flashcard3front": "What is blood glucose and what is the blood glucose target?",
    "flashcard3back": "Blood glucose or blood sugar is the main type of sugar in your blood. Your blood sugar target is like a goal range you want to hit to stay healthy. Typical targets are 80 to 130 mg/dL before meals and below 180 mg/dL two hours after eating.",
    "flashcard4front": "Why and how do you check your glucose level?",
    "flashcard4back": "Regular glucose checks are important for living with diabetes by ensuring blood sugar stays within a healthy range. You can use a blood sugar meter before and after meals to track changes and maintain your target range.",
    "flashcard5front": "What is prediabetes?",

Balancing your caloric intake supports maintaining a healthy weight and overall well-being.",
    "flashcard10front": "How To Benefit From Physical Activity",
